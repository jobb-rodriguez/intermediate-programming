# Application
Mastery of one language, especially a statically typed language like C++, will serve as the foundation for learning other languages. The concepts, algorithms, and techniques you will learn are transferrable.

| Topic | Application |
| -- | -- |
| Function Overloading and Recursion | Mastery on a crucial concept in development, functions |
| Pointers | Maximize your unit's resources by experiencing the applications of memory |
| Linked List | Your first formal data structure which will serve as the foundation for understanding the proceeding data structures |
| Structures | In practice, related data are usually accessed in a single variable |
| Classes and Objects | The foundation for Object-Oriented Programming which will help you undertand OOP concepts such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism |
| File Processing | Concept highly useful for Backend Development, Scripting, and Security (to name some fields). |
| Vectors | In production, data continuously increase. A static-sized array is an inefficient solution to accommodate the data. Utilizing vectors is a better alternative. |
